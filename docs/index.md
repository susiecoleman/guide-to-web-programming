# Programming for the Web

This guide covers HTML, CSS and Javascript which are used together to make interactive websites. They are sometimes referred to as 'front end technologies'. This is because they are used to build the part of a website the user interacts with directly. The term 'front end' is used in contrast to the term 'back end'. In web development back end refers to code running on a server. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) covers the difference between the two in more detail.

## Debugging
If a website is not loading correctly in the browser then the developer tools can be used to diagnose the problem

[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)

[Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Tools_Toolbox)

## Getting Started

A very basic website containing a javascript, html and css file already linked together can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/susiecoleman/blank-website).

## Codepen
[Codepen](https://codepen.io/#) is a website that allows you to experiment with html css and javascript in the browser. There are multiple code examples in this guide that use codepen. To experiment with changing the code click `edit on codepen` in any of the examples. Editing the examples on codepen will not affect the examples in the guide. 

Note: Codepen does not include head and body tags in it's examples so any code written would need to go inside the body tag if it was being added to a webpage.
