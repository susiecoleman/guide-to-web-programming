It gives a page of text a semantic structure e.g. This is text is a paragraph, this text is a header, this is an image, this is link. The browser will then use this information to decide how to display the text in the html document. For example, header text should be bigger than paragraph text. \n\n\nElements\n\n\nThe items that make up a web page (paragraphs, headers, images etc.) are referred to as elements. A webpage is a collection of elements.\n\n\nTags\n\n\nTags are used to indicate an element (e.g. this is a paragraph). A html document is text annotated with html tags and a web page is a html document.\n\n\nTags look like this:\n\n\np\nThis is a paragraph\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a finite list of tags as browsers need to know all available tags in order to decide how to handle them.

            "text": "CSS\n\n\nCSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is used to describe how a html document should look. In web development typically this means how it will look on the screen but it could also mean how it will look on paper. CSS is a style sheet language (as opposed to a mark up language or programming language). Using CSS styles can be applied to elements on the page.\n\n\nCSS Syntax\n\n\nCSS styles are applied to elements they have the following syntax:\n\n\nh1 {\n    color: #ff0000;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe entire block is called the rule set. This is made up of the selector (in this case \nh1\n) and the declaration (in this case \ncolor: #ff0000\n). The declaration has 2 parts, the property (\ncolor\n) and the property value (\n#ff0000\n). The selector can have multiple properties e.g.\n\n\np {\n    color: #ff00ff;\n    font-size; 10px;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSelectors\n\n\nThe selectors determine what part of the page the declarations will be applied to.\n\n\nElement Selectors\n\n\nThis is when a style is applied to every element of a certain type. In the example below there are \nh1\n, \np\n and \nspan\n tags and the selectors in the CSS have the same names as the tags they are applied to\n\n\nSee the Pen \nPRGxaG\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Selectors\n\n\nClass selectors must always have a \n.\n at the start of their name when declared in the CSS. They can have any name provided it has no spaces. To apply the class to an element use the syntax \nclass=className\n. In the example below the class \nblue-text\n is applied to a \nspan\n tag and a \nh1\n tag. Any element with the class on it will have the declarations for that class appiled to it e.g. turning the text blue.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nClass Selectors\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID Selectors\n\n\nID selectors always start with a \n#\n when declared in the CSS and can have any name provided it has no spaces. An ID can only be applied to one element and allow you to uniquely identify a single element on the page.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nID Selector\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudo Classes\n\n\nPseudo classes are added to the end of selectors to indicate that you only want the style applied on that selector when the element is in a certain state e.g. when the element is hovered over. The syntax is \nselectorName:pseudoClass\n. In the example below the paragraph text changes size when you hover over it.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nQmKzgV\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nThere is a finite list of CSS properties that can be set on elements. Common CSS properties are available \nhere\n.\n\n\nCascading Styles\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nIn CSS, inheritance controls what happens when property is set for a specific element. The the example below \ncolor\n is an inherited property. This is why the text in the span tag is red as well despite the colour of the text in the span tag never being specifically set. \nborder\n is not an inherited property only the paragraph has a border around it. The text in the span tag does not have a border around it. \n\n\nSee the Pen \nCSS Inheritance\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited styles explain why the style of your web page can change even when a style has not been applied directly to an element. These styles can be overridden by more specific styles as shown in the example below.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nOverride styles\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf multiple styles are added with the same level of importance, for example definining multiple rule sets with the same selector, the declration that is further down the document will be applied. As shown in this example:\n\n\nSee the Pen \nIdentical styles\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly conflicting rules are overridden. So in this case the background colour is applied from the first rule set but the value for the color property is overridden by the property further down the CSS document.\n\n\nPositioning Items on the Page - Box Model\n\n\nA web page is rendered by the browser as a series of boxes. CSS is used to determine the size, postition and properties (colour, border size, etc) of the box. Every box is made up of 4 parts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent: This is the actual content of the element, text, an image etc. The size is set using the properties \nwidth\n ans \nheight\n.\n\n\nPadding: This goes around the content area. The dimensions are set using \npadding-top\n, \npadding-bottom\n, \npadding-right\n and \npadding-left\n. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \npadding\n property as shorthand to set all 4 padding values.\n\n\nBorder: The border goes around the padding area. The width of the border is set using \nborder-width\n and the area. The \nborder-style\n property makes the border visible. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \nborder\n property to set multiple border properties at once.\n\n\nMargin: The margin is around the border and separates the element from it's nieghbours. The size is set using \nmargin-top\n, \nmargin-right\n, \nmargin-bottom\n, \nmargin-left\n. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \nmargin\n property as shorthand to set all 4 padding margin.\n\n\n\n\nSee the Pen \nBox Model CSS\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadding seperates content from the border and the margin add space between the element in relation to other elements.\n\n\nColour Names\n\n\nColours in CSS are usually written as \nhexidecimal numbers\n. This \nwebsite\n provides a tool to get a colour's hexidecimal value.\n\n\nApplying CSS to HTML\n\n\nTypically CSS is written in a different file to the HTML. This is known as an external stylesheet. In order for the styles in the css file to be applied to the html the css file needs to be linked to the html document. Imagine you have created 2 files in the same directory (or folder) on your computer one called style.css and one called index.html. To link them together a \nlink\n tag nested within in the \nhead\n tag is used. This is done within the head tag as linking to a style sheet is information about the webpage (metadata) as opposed to information that should appear on the webpage.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \nlink rel=\nstylesheet\n href=\nstyle.css\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles can also be applied using inline stylesheets and inline styles this article covers \nalternative approaches\n in more detail.",

It is used in front end web development but it is very versitile so it can also be used in back end development. The concepts covered are applicable to other programming languages.\n\n\nJavascript is a series of instructions each instruction ends with a semicolon and the instructions are executed in the order they are written in the file.\n\n\nJSBin\n\n\nJSBin\n is an online service that allows you to test out javascript. Javascript goes in the left hand pane then just click run to see the results. However to get anything to print out you will need to use \nconsole.log()\n. There are links to interactive examples of all the javascript code in this guide.\n\n\nDebugging - Console.log\n\n\nThe \nconsole.log\n command outputs a message to the \nweb console\n. This is useful for finding out what is going wrong with a program, for example logging the value of a variable.\n\n\nconsole.log(\nThis is a console log.\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nVariables are used to assign names to values. For example the number \n200\n could refer to anything but if it is assigned to a variable \nvar heightInCm = 200\n it has a meaning. Variables can be reassigned to new values e.g.\n\n\nvar heightInCm = 200;\nheightInCm = 151;\n\n\n\n\nIn these examples \nvar\n is used to create a variable. Javascript also has \nconst\n and \nlet\n for declaring variables but they work slightly differently. The \ndeclarations\n part of this guide covers the differences.\n\n\nvar name;\nname = \nSusie\n;\nvar height = 171;\n\nname = \nAnna\n;\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nTypes\n\n\n\n\nBoolean - This type can have only 2 values \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nNumber - These can be whole numbers (integers) or decimals (floating point numbers)\n\n\nStrings - A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes\n\n\n\n\n// Boolean values\nvar skyIsBlue = true;\nvar earthIsFlat = false;\n\n// Integers\nvar total = 35;\n\n// Floating point numbers\nvar pi = 3.14;\n\n// Strings\nvar capitalCity = \nLondon\n;\nvar meaningOfLife = \n42\n;\nvar punctuation = \n@\u00a3$`!!{}\n;\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nOperations on Numbers\n\n\nIn javascript it is possible to add \n+\n subtract \n-\n multiply \n*\n and divide \n/\n numbers. Numbers can also be incremented using \n++\n and decremented using \n--\n\n\nComments\n\n\n//\n In a javascript file denotes a comment. Any line that starts with \n//\n The browser will ignore. So in this example\n\n\nvar x = 5;\n// x = 6;\nconsole.log(x);\n\n\n\n\nThe value printed out will be 5\n\n\nArrays\n\n\nAn array is a list of items. For example\n\n\n[1,2,3];\n[];\n[\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\n[4, \ncat\n, true];\n\n\n\n\nare all arrays. But typically they are assigned to a variable\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple operations that can be performed on an array. It is possible to get a specific item from an array by it's index:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nvar firstItem = shoppingList[0];\n\n\n\n\nNote the index of an array start from zero. It is also possible to get the number of items in a list:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nvar length = shoppingList.length;\n\n\n\n\nand add an item to the end of the list:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nshoppingList.push(\ndates\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive version of all array examples\n\n\nFull guide on arrays\n\n\nConditional Statements\n\n\nThese are also know as \nif else\n statements. They are used to make sure that code is only executed if a statement is true. For example you might want your program to do something different depending on whether a variable has an even or an odd value. An if statement has the following structure:\n\n\nif(condition){\n    statement;\n} else {\n    otherStatement;\n}\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nstatement\n is executed if the condition is true and \notherStatement\n is executed if it is false. \n\n\nConditions\n\n\nThe condition is a statement that evaluates to true or false. The expressions below all evaluate to true and show the different ways of comparing 2 items \n\n\n// 3 is equal to 3\n    3 === 3\n// 3 is not equal to 2\n    3 !== 2\n// 3 is less than 5\n    3 \n 5\n// 3 is greater than 1\n    3 \n 1\n// 3 is less than or equal to 3\n    3 \n= 3\n// 3 is greater than or equal to 3\n    3 \n= 3\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\nvar number = 5;\nif(number !== 5) {\n    console.log(\nThis is true\n);\n} else {\n    console.log(\nThis is false\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nConditional statements make code more interesting. Up to this point all the code has done the same thing every time it is run. With the introduction of if statement what the code does when executed now depends on whether or not the conditional statement is true or false. In the example above if number is assigned to 6 instead of 5 the code will do something different when it is run.\n\n\nLoops\n\n\nA common scenario in programming is to want to execute the same instruction multiple times. For example printing to the console. One solution is to write the same line of code multiple times:\n\n\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\n\n\n\n\nHowever this is time consuming (even with copy and paste) and if we wanted to print \ngoodbye\n instead it would be neccessary to change it 5 times. A better solution is to use a loop.\n\n\nFor Loops\n\n\nA for loop will repeat until a condition is false. So if the condition is never false it will run forever.\n\n\nfor(var i = 0; i \n 5 ; i++) {\n    console.log(\nhello\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Example\n\n\nWhat the code above does is:\n\n\n\n\ncreate a variable called \ni\n and give it the value \n0\n\n\ncheck if \ni\n is less than \n5\n\n\nexecute the code inside the curly brackets: \nconsole.log(\"hello\")\n\n\nAdd \n1\n to \ni\n\n\n\n\nThe code will continue to loop doing steps 2 to 4 until i is no longer less than 5. Once the loop has finished running the next line of code will be executed. For example for this program:\n\n\nfor(var i = 0; i \n 5 ; i++) {\n    console.log(\nhello\n);\n}\nconsole.log(\nFinished executing loop\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nThe output would be:\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nFinished executing loop\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable \ni\n we create can also be referred to in the code. For example if we wanted to print the numbers 1 to 10:\n\n\nfor(var i = 1; i \n= 10 ; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nFor Loops and Lists\n\n\nFor loops can be used to iterate through lists.\n\n\nvar fruits = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nfor(var i = 0; i \n fruits.length; i++) {\n    console.log(fruits[i]);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nIn this example the condition that makes the loop stops looping is related to the length of the list. Also the variable \ni\n is used as the index to retreive items from the list.\n\n\nFunctions\n\n\nFunctions are a way to prevent you from having to write the same piece of code mutiple times. For example if you had to find the mean of 3 lists you would need to do the following:\n\n\nvar mathsTestScores = [50, 70, 35, 60]\nvar mathsTotal = 0;\nfor(var i = 0; i \n mathsTestScores.length; i++) {\n    mathsTotal = mathsTotal + mathsTestScores[i];\n}\nvar mathsAverageScore = mathsTotal / mathsTestScores.length\n\nvar scienceTestScores = [65, 93, 52, 10]\nvar scienceTotal = 0;\nfor(var i = 0; i \n scienceTestScores.length; i++) {\n    scienceTotal = scienceTotal + scienceTestScores[i];\n}\nvar scienceAverageScore = scienceTotal / scienceTestScores.length\n\nvar englishTestScores = [53, 80, 49, 61]\nvar englishTotal = 0;\nfor(var i = 0; i \n englishTestScores.length; i++) {\n    englishTotal = englishTotal + englishTestScores[i];\n}\nvar englishAverageScore = englishTotal / englishTestScores.length\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nThis is a lot of duplicated code. This is more effort to type out but also it's more likely you will make mistakes than if you were only typing it out once. Also if you changed the way you calculated the average and wanted the median instead of the mean you would need to change the code in lots of places.\n\n\nThe solution is to use functions. Functions are bits of code that can be reused.\n\n\nThe Syntax\n\n\nfunction printHello() {\n    console.log(\nHello!\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few different parts to a function. First the \nfunction\n bit. This is to indicate that this will be a function. \nprintHello\n this is the name of the function. Like variables this is how we refer to the function elsewhere in the code. You should give a function a name that reflects what it does. All functions need \n()\n, later examples will show why. The \n{}\n surround the code that belongs to the function and determines what the code actually does. So in the example above the function will console log \nHello!\n.\n\n\nThis code is not enough to actually get the function to do anything it just defines what the function will do. To actually get the code to log \nHello!\n to the console you need to call it.\n\n\nprintHello();\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nThe name followed by \n()\n will execute the function and will cause the code inside the function to run. This is called calling a function. The function can be called many times.\n\n\nMore Interesting Functions\n\n\nA common problem in programming is performing a calculation for example working out the average of a list of scores. In order to do this the function also needs to know which list it is calculating the average of. This means the function also needs a parameter. This allows the caller of the function to give the function extra information.\n\n\nfunction calculateMean(scores){\n    var total = 0;\n    for(var i = 0; i \n scores.length; i++) {\n        total = total + total[i];\n    }\n    var mean = total / scores.length;\n    console.log(mean);\n}\nvar mathsTestScores = [50, 70, 35, 60];\nvar scienceTestScores = [65, 93, 52, 10];\nvar englishTestScores = [53, 80, 49, 61];\ncalculateMean(mathsTestScores);\ncalculateMean(englishTestScores);\ncalculateMean(scienceTestScores);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nIn this example the test scores are passed in and the result is logged to the console. There is much less duplication.\n\n\nReturning Values\n\n\nIn all the fucntion examples so far the result is logged straight to the console. This is not very useful. For example if you were making a website for a school you probably wouldn't want to log the mean score but display them on a website. This is done by using the return statement.\n\n\nfunction calculateMean(scores){\n    var total = 0;\n    for(var i = 0; i \n scores.length; i++) {\n        total = total + scores[i];\n    }\n    var mean = total / scores.length;\n    return mean;\n}\nvar mathsTestScores = [50, 70, 35, 60];\nvar mean = calculateMean(mathsTestScores);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nNow the function doesn't log anything to the console it returns the result to the caller. In this example we have taken this value and assigned it to the variable called \nmean\n. We can now do anything with this variable we would do with any other variable. It could be logged to the console, displayed on a web page, passed to another function etc.",

The  {}  surround the code that belongs to the function and determines what the code actually does. So in the example above the function will console log  Hello! .

            "text": "Interactive Javascript\n\n\nJavascript can be used to manipulate the HTML that makes up a webpage. This allows the page to be interactive and change depending on what actions a user does. For example, you could define a button using the html tag \nbutton\n. You could combine this with javascript to detect when the button is clicked. The javascript code that runs after you click the button could change the CSS to make the font of the page larger. This is an example of HTML, CSS and javascript all working together so that a webpage is interactive. You can write a webpage using only HTML and CSS. The webpage will look the same for everyone who visits it. This is called a static webpage, it never changes. By using javascript you can make a dynamic website, this is a website that changes based on user actions.\n\n\nThe DOM (Document Object Model)\n\n\nThe DOM is provided by the javascript language and lets you easily access parts of a html page and then manipulate the page, for example changing the font colour or adding more html to a page. This is how interactivity can be added to a website. \n\n\nFor example if you wanted to build a multiple choice quiz website with radio buttons for every possible answer and a button to allow whoever visited your website to check their answers. You would write the questions and the check button in a html document. But you would need to add javascript to make it interactive. The javascript code would run when the button was pressed. The javascript code would find the radio buttons in the html page and see which ones were selected. From this you could work out how many your user got right. The javascript code could then add a paragraph element to the html page telling the user how many answers the user got right. \n\n\nUsing the DOM to get HTML elements\n\n\nvar body = document.body\n\n\nThis will get everything inside the \nbody\n tag on the html page and assign to to the variable \nbody\n. The HTML page of this guide covered how a HTML page can be viewed as a tree where every HTML tag has a parent and children. This model can be applied here as well. Once we have used \ndocument.body\n and have the body we can get all the children of body.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \ntitle\nBees Website\n/title\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n        \nh1\nBees\n/h1\n\n        \np\nI like bees.\n/p\n\n        \np\nBees are nice.\n/p\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example HTML document the body tag has 3 children\n\n\nh1\nBees\n/h1\n\n\np\nI like bees.\n/p\n\n\np\nBees are nice\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nTo select these 3 elements in our javascript code we can do:\n\n\n//Get the body of the html page\nvar body = document.body;\n//Get all the children of the body. This will return an array.\nvar children = body.children;\n\n\n\n\nBecause our html page is just a tree we can 'walk the tree' and keep getting the children of children nodes until we get the element we need. \n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \ntitle\nBees Website\n/title\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n        \nh1\nBees\n/h1\n\n        \nul\n\n            \nli\nHoney Bees\n/li\n\n            \nli\nBumblebees\n/li\n\n            \nli\nStingless Bees\n/li\n\n        \n/ul\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example if we had this webpage and wanted the second item on the list we could do:\n\n\n//Get the body of the html page\nvar body = document.body;\n//Get all the children of the body. This will return an array.\nvar children = body.children;\n//Get the second item on the list (Don't forget the first item on a list is at index 0)\nvar beeList = children[1];\n//Get the second item on the list\nvar itemTwo = list[1];\n\n\n\n\nBut this can get quite complicated especially if you have a complex webpage. It is possible to get an item on the page directly.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \ntitle\nBees Website\n/title\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n        \nh1\nBees\n/h1\n\n        \nul\n\n            \nli\nHoney Bees\n/li\n\n            \nli id='second'\nBumblebees\n/li\n\n            \nli\nStingless Bees\n/li\n\n        \n/ul\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the same webpage but with an id on item 2 in the list. Now it's easy to get the element directly.\n\n\nvar item2 = document.getElementById('second');\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is to get all elements by type. For example if you wanted to add an accessablity button to your website to allow a user to change the font size of all of the paragraphs. It would be really useful to be able to select all of the paragraphs at once.\n\n\n//Gets an array of all the paragraphs\nvar paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName(\np\n);\n//Gets an array of all the images\nvar images = document.getElementsByTagName(\nimg\n);\n\n\n\n\nUsing Javascript to Set Attributes\n\n\nEvent Listeners\n\n\nApplying Javascript to HTML\n\n\nTypically Javascript is written in a different file to the HTML. In order for the javascript to run when the html page is loaded the javascript file needs to be linked to the html document. Imagine you have created 2 files in the same directory (or folder) on your computer one called script.js and one called index.html. To link them together a \nscript\n tag is used.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n        \nh1\nMy Website\n/h1\n\n        \nscript src=\nscript.js\n/script\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nThe script tag can in theory go anywhere as long as it's within the \nhtml\n tag. However it typically is the final tag within the body tag so that all of the html content is parsed by the browser before it tries to get the javascript file. This allows your user to start reading the site even if the javascript hasn't yet run. This is useful for slow web connections. Also it means all the elements of the page that the javascript might manipute or refer to will have been rendered by the browser.",
