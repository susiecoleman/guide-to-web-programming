It gives a page of text a semantic structure e.g. This is text is a paragraph, this text is a header, this is an image, this is link. The browser will then use this information to decide how to display the text in the html document. For example, header text should be bigger than paragraph text. \n\n\nElements\n\n\nThe items that make up a web page (paragraphs, headers, images etc.) are referred to as elements. A webpage is a collection of elements.\n\n\nTags\n\n\nTags are used to indicate an element (e.g. this is a paragraph). A html document is text annotated with html tags and a web page is a html document.\n\n\nTags look like this:\n\n\np\nThis is a paragraph\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a finite list of tags as browsers need to know all available tags in order to decide how to handle them.

            "text": "CSS\n\n\nCSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is used to describe how a html document should look. In web development typically this means how it will look on the screen but it could also mean how it will look on paper. CSS is a style sheet language (as opposed to a mark up language or programming language). Using CSS styles can be applied to elements on the page.\n\n\nCSS Syntax\n\n\nCSS styles are applied to elements they have the following syntax:\n\n\nh1 {\n    color: #ff0000;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe entire block is called the rule set. This is made up of the selector (in this case \nh1\n) and the declaration (in this case \ncolor: #ff0000\n). The declaration has 2 parts, the property (\ncolor\n) and the property value (\n#ff0000\n). The selector can have multiple properties e.g.\n\n\np {\n    color: #ff00ff;\n    font-size; 10px;\n}\n\n\n\n\nSelectors\n\n\nThe selectors determine what part of the page the declarations will be applied to.\n\n\nElement Selectors\n\n\nThis is when a style is applied to every element of a certain type. In the example below there are \nh1\n, \np\n and \nspan\n tags and the selectors in the CSS have the same names as the tags they are applied to\n\n\nSee the Pen \nPRGxaG\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass Selectors\n\n\nClass selectors must always have a \n.\n at the start of their name when declared in the CSS. They can have any name provided it has no spaces. To apply the class to an element use the syntax \nclass=className\n. In the example below the class \nblue-text\n is applied to a \nspan\n tag and a \nh1\n tag. Any element with the class on it will have the declarations for that class appiled to it e.g. turning the text blue.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nClass Selectors\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID Selectors\n\n\nID selectors always start with a \n#\n when declared in the CSS and can have any name provided it has no spaces. An ID can only be applied to one element and allow you to uniquely identify a single element on the page.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nID Selector\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudo Classes\n\n\nPseudo classes are added to the end of selectors to indicate that you only want the style applied on that selector when the element is in a certain state e.g. when the element is hovered over. The syntax is \nselectorName:pseudoClass\n. In the example below the paragraph text changes size when you hover over it.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nQmKzgV\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nThere is a finite list of CSS properties that can be set on elements. Common CSS properties are available \nhere\n.\n\n\nCascading Styles\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nIn CSS, inheritance controls what happens when property is set for a specific element. The the example below \ncolor\n is an inherited property. This is why the text in the span tag is red as well despite the colour of the text in the span tag never being specifically set. \nborder\n is not an inherited property only the paragraph has a border around it. The text in the span tag does not have a border around it. \n\n\nSee the Pen \nCSS Inheritance\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInherited styles explain why the style of your web page can change even when a style has not been applied directly to an element. These styles can be overridden by more specific styles as shown in the example below.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nOverride styles\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf multiple styles are added with the same level of importance, for example definining multiple rule sets with the same selector, the declration that is further down the document will be applied. As shown in this example:\n\n\nSee the Pen \nIdentical styles\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly conflicting rules are overridden. So in this case the background colour is applied from the first rule set but the value for the color property is overridden by the property further down the CSS document.\n\n\nPositioning Items on the Page - Box Model\n\n\nA web page is rendered by the browser as a series of boxes. CSS is used to determine the size, postition and properties (colour, border size, etc) of the box. Every box is made up of 4 parts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent: This is the actual content of the element, text, an image etc. The size is set using the properties \nwidth\n ans \nheight\n.\n\n\nPadding: This goes around the content area. The dimensions are set using \npadding-top\n, \npadding-bottom\n, \npadding-right\n and \npadding-left\n. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \npadding\n property as shorthand to set all 4 padding values.\n\n\nBorder: The border goes around the padding area. The width of the border is set using \nborder-width\n and the area. The \nborder-style\n property makes the border visible. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \nborder\n property to set multiple border properties at once.\n\n\nMargin: The margin is around the border and separates the element from it's nieghbours. The size is set using \nmargin-top\n, \nmargin-right\n, \nmargin-bottom\n, \nmargin-left\n. This \nguide\n covers how to use the \nmargin\n property as shorthand to set all 4 padding margin.\n\n\n\n\nSee the Pen \nBox Model CSS\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadding seperates content from the border and the margin add space between the element in relation to other elements.\n\n\nColour Names\n\n\nColours in CSS are usually written as \nhexidecimal numbers\n. This \nwebsite\n provides a tool to get a colour's hexidecimal value.\n\n\nApplying CSS to HTML\n\n\nTypically CSS is written in a different file to the HTML. This is known as an external stylesheet. In order for the styles in the css file to be applied to the html the css file needs to be linked to the html document. Imagine you have created 2 files in the same directory (or folder) on your computer one called style.css and one called index.html. To link them together a \nlink\n tag nested within in the \nhead\n tag is used. This is done within the head tag as linking to a style sheet is information about the webpage (metadata) as opposed to information that should appear on the webpage.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \nlink rel=\nstylesheet\n href=\nstyle.css\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nStyles can also be applied using inline stylesheets and inline styles this article covers \nalternative approaches\n in more detail.",

The text in the span tag does not have a border around it.   See the Pen  CSS Inheritance  by Susie ( @susiec20 ) on  CodePen .   Inherited styles explain why the style of your web page can change even when a style has not been applied directly to an element. These styles can be overridden by more specific styles as shown in the example below.  See the Pen  Override styles  by Susie ( @susiec20 ) on  CodePen .   If multiple styles are added with the same level of importance, for example definining multiple rule sets with the same selector, the declration that is further down the document will be applied. As shown in this example:  See the Pen  Identical styles  by Susie ( @susiec20 ) on  CodePen .   Only conflicting rules are overridden.

It is used in front end web development but it is very versitile so it can also be used in back end development. The concepts covered are applicable to other programming languages.\n\n\nJavascript is a series of instructions each instruction ends with a semicolon and the instructions are executed in the order they are written in the file.\n\n\nJSBin\n\n\nJSBin\n is an online service that allows you to test out javascript. Javascript goes in the left hand pane then just click run to see the results. However to get anything to print out you will need to use \nconsole.log()\n. There are links to interactive examples of all the javascript code in this guide.\n\n\nDebugging - Console.log\n\n\nThe \nconsole.log\n command outputs a message to the \nweb console\n. This is useful for finding out what is going wrong with a program, for example logging the value of a variable.\n\n\nconsole.log(\nThis is a console log.\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nVariables\n\n\nVariables are used to assign names to values. For example the number \n200\n could refer to anything but if it is assigned to a variable \nvar heightInCm = 200\n it has a meaning. Variables can be reassigned to new values e.g.\n\n\nvar heightInCm = 200;\nheightInCm = 151;\n\n\n\n\nIn these examples \nvar\n is used to create a variable. Javascript also has \nconst\n and \nlet\n for declaring variables but they work slightly differently. The \ndeclarations\n part of this guide covers the differences.\n\n\nvar name;\nname = \nSusie\n;\nvar height = 171;\n\nname = \nAnna\n;\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nTypes\n\n\n\n\nBoolean - This type can have only 2 values \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nNumber - These can be whole numbers (integers) or decimals (floating point numbers)\n\n\nStrings - A sequence of characters surrounded by quotes\n\n\n\n\n// Boolean values\nvar skyIsBlue = true;\nvar earthIsFlat = false;\n\n// Integers\nvar total = 35;\n\n// Floating point numbers\nvar pi = 3.14;\n\n// Strings\nvar capitalCity = \nLondon\n;\nvar meaningOfLife = \n42\n;\nvar punctuation = \n@\u00a3$`!!{}\n;\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nOperations on Numbers\n\n\nIn javascript it is possible to add \n+\n subtract \n-\n multiply \n*\n and divide \n/\n numbers. Numbers can also be incremented using \n++\n and decremented using \n--\n\n\nComments\n\n\n//\n In a javascript file denotes a comment. Any line that starts with \n//\n The browser will ignore. So in this example\n\n\nvar x = 5;\n// x = 6;\nconsole.log(x);\n\n\n\n\nThe value printed out will be 5\n\n\nArrays\n\n\nAn array is a list of items. For example\n\n\n[1,2,3];\n[];\n[\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\n[4, \ncat\n, true];\n\n\n\n\nare all arrays. But typically they are assigned to a variable\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple operations that can be performed on an array. It is possible to get a specific item from an array by it's index:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nvar firstItem = shoppingList[0];\n\n\n\n\nNote the index of an array start from zero. It is also possible to get the number of items in a list:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nvar length = shoppingList.length;\n\n\n\n\nand add an item to the end of the list:\n\n\nvar shoppingList = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nshoppingList.push(\ndates\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive version of all array examples\n\n\nFull guide on arrays\n\n\nConditional Statements\n\n\nThese are also know as \nif else\n statements. They are used to make sure that code is only executed if a statement is true. For example you might want your program to do something different depending on whether a variable has an even or an odd value. An if statement has the following structure:\n\n\nif(condition){\n    statement;\n} else {\n    otherStatement;\n}\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nstatement\n is executed if the condition is true and \notherStatement\n is executed if it is false. \n\n\nConditions\n\n\nThe condition is a statement that evaluates to true or false. The expressions below all evaluate to true and show the different ways of comparing 2 items \n\n\n// 3 is equal to 3\n    3 === 3\n// 3 is not equal to 2\n    3 !== 2\n// 3 is less than 5\n    3 \n 5\n// 3 is greater than 1\n    3 \n 1\n// 3 is less than or equal to 3\n    3 \n= 3\n// 3 is greater than or equal to 3\n    3 \n= 3\n\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\nvar number = 5;\nif(number !== 5) {\n    console.log(\nThis is true\n);\n} else {\n    console.log(\nThis is false\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nConditional statements make code more interesting. Up to this point all the code has done the same thing every time it is run. With the introduction of if statement what the code does when executed now depends on whether or not the conditional statement is true or false. In the example above if number is assigned to 6 instead of 5 the code will do something different when it is run.\n\n\nLoops\n\n\nA common scenario in programming is to want to execute the same instruction multiple times. For example printing to the console. One solution is to write the same line of code multiple times:\n\n\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\nconsole.log(\nhello\n);\n\n\n\n\nHowever this is time consuming (even with copy and paste) and if we wanted to print \ngoodbye\n instead it would be neccessary to change it 5 times. A better solution is to use a loop.\n\n\nFor Loops\n\n\nA for loop will repeat until a condition is false. So if the condition is never false it will run forever.\n\n\nfor(var i = 0; i \n 5 ; i++) {\n    console.log(\nhello\n);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Example\n\n\nWhat the code above does is:\n\n\n\n\ncreate a variable called \ni\n and give it the value \n0\n\n\ncheck if \ni\n is less than \n5\n\n\nexecute the code inside the curly brackets: \nconsole.log(\"hello\")\n\n\nAdd \n1\n to \ni\n\n\n\n\nThe code will continue to loop doing steps 2 to 4 until i is no longer less than 5. Once the loop has finished running the next line of code will be executed. For example for this program:\n\n\nfor(var i = 0; i \n 5 ; i++) {\n    console.log(\nhello\n);\n}\nconsole.log(\nFinished executing loop\n);\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nThe output would be:\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nhello\n\n\nFinished executing loop\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable \ni\n we create can also be referred to in the code. For example if we wanted to print the numbers 1 to 10:\n\n\nfor(var i = 1; i \n= 10 ; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nFor Loops and Lists\n\n\nFor loops can be used to iterate through lists.\n\n\nvar fruits = [\napple\n, \nbanana\n, \ncherry\n];\nfor(var i = 0; i \n fruits.length; i++) {\n    console.log(fruits[i]);\n}\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Version\n\n\nIn this example the condition that makes the loop stops looping is related to the length of the list. Also the variable \ni\n is used as the index to retreive items from the list.\n\n\nTODO Applying Javascript to HTML",
