            "text": "HTML\n\n\nHTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It gives a page of text a semantic structure e.g. This is text is a paragraph, this text is a header, this is an image, this is link. The browser will then use this information to decide how to display the text in the html document. For example, header text should be bigger than paragraph text. \n\n\nElements\n\n\nThe items that make up a web page (paragraphs, headers, images etc.) are referred to as elements. A webpage is a collection of elements.\n\n\nTags\n\n\nTags are used to indicate an element (e.g. this is a paragraph). A html document is text annotated with html tags and a web page is a html document.\n\n\nTags look like this:\n\n\np\nThis is a paragraph\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a finite list of tags as browsers need to know all available tags in order to decide how to handle them. This list is maintained by \nW3C (World Wide Web Consortium)\n. A list of all elements is available \nhere\n. \n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nElements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element or adjust the behaviour of the element. For example when using an \nimage tag\n an attribute is used to provide the link to an image. When using a \nform tag\n you can use it's autocomplete attribute to determine whether or not values can be autocompleted by the browswer. A list of all attributes is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nAttributes on tags look like this:\n\n\np style=\ncolor:red\nThis is a paragraph with an attribute\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nStructuring a HTML Document\n\n\nThis is a very basic HTML document.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a html document there is a top level tag (\nhtml\n) and then the other tags are nested within these tags. Between an opening and closing tag of the same type there can be text and there can be other html tags\n\n\nThis means the structure of a webpage is like a tree. The \nhtml\n tag is the top level tag and it has 2 children \nhead\n and \nbody\n. The \nhead\n tag has metadata about the page e.g. links to the css and the \nbody\n tag contains the html for content that will appear on your site.\n\n\nTODO Tree diagram\n\n\nThis is a more complicated example including some more html tags.\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead\n\n        \ntitle\nBees Website\n/title\n\n        \nlink rel=\nstylesheet\n href=\nstyle.css\n\n    \n/head\n\n    \nbody\n\n        \nh1\nBees\n/h1\n\n        \np\nBees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the European honey bee, for producing honey and beeswax. Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families. They are found on every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.\n/p\n\n        \np\nSome species including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\n/p\n\n        \nimg src=\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Bee-apis.jpg\n /\n\n    \n/body\n\n\n/html\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows what the html looks like when rendered by a browser. By clicking on 'edit on Codepen' you can experiment with changing the html or adding new html tags. Note codepen does not include head and body tags in it's examples so any code written here would need to go inside the body tag if it was being added to a webpage.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nBasic HTML Elements\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiv and Span Tag\n\n\nTags do two things:\n\n\n\n\nProvide semantic information about the parts of the website (Paragraphs, headers, images)\n\n\nGroup information together. This is shown by nested tags. For example the body tag indicates that everything between the opening body tag and closing body tag is part of the visible web site. \n\n\n\n\nThe div and span tag have no effect on the layout until they are styled by css. This is useful for grouping content together or selecting a specific piece of content without having to worry about overriding default styles.\n\n\nDiv tag\n\n\nA \ndiv\n tag is a block element which means by default it takes up the full width of the page. But this can be changed using css.\n\n\nThis example shows using div tags to group the content into 2 columns. Then css is used to add the style that makes the content appear in 2 columns. The html tag is providing the semantic information 'this content is in 2 columns' and the css what actually makes the content appear in 2 columns.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nBasic usecase for divs\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpan tag\n\n\nA \nspan\n tag is an inline element which means it only occupies the space bounded by the tag rather than taking up the full width of the page.\n\n\nThis example shows how to use a span tag to apply a style to specific part of the paragraph.\n\n\nSee the Pen \nBasic span example\n by Susie (\n@susiec20\n) on \nCodePen\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more detailed summary and example of the difference between inline and block level elements is available on the \nMDN web docs",
